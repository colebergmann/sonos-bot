# sonos-bot
This is the software backend for sonos-bot, the culmination of a 3-quarter capstone project with Sonos and UCSB Mechanical Engineering. (work in progress)

This software is built in Python, using Flask to host a web interface that allow users to interact with the robot. It will be hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4 communicating with 3 stepper motors via GPIO.
